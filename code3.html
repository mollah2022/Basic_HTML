                An aimless person is like a ship that has lost its control over the sea. The Aim is defined as a strong will to achieve something. Every person must have a well-defined objective in life. It helps a person to understand the direction of his/her career.

Every person has a set of goals in life that they want to reach. To achieve their goal, that person needs to work hard, and aims/goals help a person attain his value in society. A personâ€™s surroundings inspire an aim or purpose. Choosing the right goal directs the person on the right path. Therefore, setting an aim and working hard to achieve it is very important for a successful life.
